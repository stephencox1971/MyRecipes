# MyRecipes

Simple one page web app, started as an exercise in basic Front End Development, as part of my Full Stack course with Codemasters.
Utilises Bootstrap 4.0 for layout.
On document load the main body text is loaded at random via javaScript.

TODO: Replace ipsum with my own recipes; replace images with my own photography; add database on backend; move recipes into loadable templates; add blod and add comments feature.
